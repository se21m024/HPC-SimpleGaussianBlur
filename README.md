Create an OpenCL program that reads an image from a file, applies a Gaussian blur to it and stores the result
back to an output image file. A Gaussian blur is a very common image filter. There should be plenty of
information and implementation details online (e.g. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gaussian_blur). Please do
not hesitate to approach me if you have any problems finding appropriate sources online.

# General Requirements

Each kernel invocation should only write a single pixel value to the output image

- The Gaussian filter kernel can have a variable size (up to size 9) and should be provided as a kernel
  argument
- The resulting image should preserve its overall brightness after applying the filter
- Do not use the image memory object! Utilize normal buffer memory objects
- Beware of borders, and clamp sampling to the nearest valid pixel (see example in side notes)
- Use a 2-dimensional NDRange (using width and height of source image)
- The blur should also work with images where width != height
- Query device capabilities to make sure the NDRange is valid for the system
- Make sure to test your program thoroughly, it has to run on my machine without any changes!
- Code cleanliness will influence grading, so make sure to tidy up your code!
- Upload a .zip file containing the complete Project with all required files/libraries to Moodle
- Implement the Program in one of the following
  o C/C++ using the official OpenCL C API. The OpenCL C++ Bindings are not allowed!
- C# using OpenCL.NET https://www.nuget.org/packages/OpenCL.Net/
- Java using JOCL http://www.jocl.org/downloads/JOCL-0.2.0-RC-bin.zip

# Side Notes

- You can freely choose the source image format
- Memory coalescing and local memory bank conflicts (see Unit 5) do not need to be considered
- Java (BufferedImage) and C# (Bitmap) provide already classes to read/write images. For C++ you can
  find a .tga image reader/writer in Moodle (but you can use whatever library you want)
- The kernel filter values do not need to be calculated and can be hardcoded in your program.
  You can generate your own Gaussian filter kernels (2D filter for simple and separable filter for
  improved version) using the generator program found in Moodle. Kernel size and blur strength is
  adjusted by changing the appropriate defines. To run the program, you can simply copy-paste it into
  an online Cpp Debugger (e.g.: https://www.onlinegdb.com).
- Example for border handling: The image below has a width and height of 6 pixels. Valid pixel
  coordinates are thus between [0, 0] and [5,5] (red box). If you need to sample a pixel outside this
  area, you should instead use the nearest valid pixel. E.g. All samples in the green box (which are
  outside the valid image area) should use the pixel value of [0,2] instead.
